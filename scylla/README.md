### Scylla Cluster Api

> [!NOTE]
> I highly recommend using [rust](https://github.com/Akzestia/zclp-rs) implementation,
> cause c++ one takes at least 10 times more code to be written for the same functionality xD

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both implementation work in the exact same way so u can use whenever u want,
> but as mentioned before, c++ takes more time to write
